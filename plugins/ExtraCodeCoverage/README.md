This plugin includes a subset of test files from the [extra tests](../../extra-tests/classes/) directory; while I encourage users to write their own tests surrounding rollup behavior, I also recognize that won't always be possible. This plugin aims to bridge the possible gap in code coverage for the classes installed as part of the base package!
