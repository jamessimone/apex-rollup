# Namespaced Version Of Apex Rollup

⚠ This package is currently in beta only. I plan to add the fully operational namespaced package in a release or two. ⚠

This package contains the exact same source code as the unlocked Apex Rollup package; it's just created with a namespace. For more info, see the base `README`.
